«Ἄρην - England.

Whose death as all that dyc they sore lame-nr

And fill the skies with cryesz impanent

Of nothing more then passe and fearetull demh,

Which old and young bereaues of vitall breath;

Their dead wrapt vp m Mats to th gmt1cthcy gine,

Vpright from th* knees‚with goods whnst they did hue,

Which they best lou’d: thexreyesturn'd to the Ean,

To which after much time, to be relcast

They all must March‚wherean oman all things haue

Thac beart can wish, or they tvhemsexues can eraut,

A second profit which by many wiues

They haue, ns Corne, thcstaffeofaH theirliueS.

All are great catere, be‘ s most rich whose bed

Affords hi‘m ch'ildt‘est, profit, piensurq bread.

But if fieret Mars, be ins bis bow to bend,

Each King stands on is guard, {zet-‹esu› defend

Their strength of lise theu· Corne sthat lost, they long ,

By this one Arc, thest Natiues οἷς sarviae

Their great’st opponam, aad in honour thriue.

Resides, their women, which for th'moss part are

Of comely formes, not blacke, nor very faire:

Wbose beautie is a beauteous blacke laid on

Their paler cheeke, which they most doat vpon.

Fon· they by Nature are both faire and white,
