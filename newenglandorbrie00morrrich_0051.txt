Yet they no feafls (that 1 can learne) obstrue,
Resides their ceres, which do’tb them preserue.
No dayes by them descernd <from other ·daye5‚

Yet they when extreame beate ἀστὴ ill their Come,

One good, which giu-es all ood,and doth ptesemes

But Natum qaiee‘eneru'd of all such right,

That hell must haue ten thousand thousand heireS,
