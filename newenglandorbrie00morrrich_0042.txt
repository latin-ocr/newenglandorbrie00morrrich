So that the Region of the ayrc is blest
With what Barths mortals wnssz to be poffist.
Great ‘Titan danes on her his heavenly rayeS,
thrcby cxtteamcs he quens, and overswayes.
Blcn is this ayte whh what the syre can bleffe3
Yet frequent ghufas doe chh this place diffieffe=
Here vnffeene ghusss doe instant on-let gine,
As heaven and earth they would together driue.
An instant power doth surprize their tage,
In their vali prison, and their force asswage.
Thus in exchange a day or two is spent,
In smiles and ftowncs t in great yet no content.
The ear'th grand parent to allthings on earth,
Cold, dry, and beavie, and the next beneath
The ayre by Natuses arme with low disce-ms,
Is as it were intrench132gaine ascems
Mount vp to heaven by Ioues omizipotence,
Whoselooming greeneffe ioyes the Sea-massonem
Invites him ιο a landis he can see,
Worthy the Thrones of ssately soveraigntie.
The fruitfull and well watered earth· doth glad
An hearts ς when Flora’s with her spangles clad,
And yeelds an hundred sold for one,
To {eede the Bee and to invite the drone.
Ο happie plantet if you knew the height
Of Plantas-honours where thet’s such delight3
There Natures bonaties though not planted are,
Great stote and formos ben-ies great and faire:
The Fssbeffl, Chen-y, and the fmitfuss Viae,
Which chenres the hem-t and makes it more divine.
Earths spangled beauties pleafing smelland fightt.
Obieas for galfant choyce and chiese delight.
